# Goods and Trade Balance Analysis

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of India's global trade patterns, focusing on exports for goods and services. The dataset used comes from the Ministry of Commerce and Trade, India and provides historical records that help analyze the country's trade performance over time.

The objective of this analysis is to identify trends, understand factors contributing to trade surpluses or deficits, and generate insights that can inform economic policies and business strategies. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we have visualized the trends in trade metrics, investigated correlations, and broken down key trade indicators for better insights.

## Analysis Overview
1. Data Cleaning
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and checked for any missing, duplicate, or incorrect values.
Ensured consistency in formats (e.g., date and currency fields).
Handled any missing values by forward-filling or removing incomplete records where necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed the dataset using statistical and graphical methods.
Correlations: Checked for correlations between key variables like Share% and Growth%
Trend Analysis: Visualized trends in total trade balance, and goods/services-specific balances using line plots and bar charts.
